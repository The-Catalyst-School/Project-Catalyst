# Assess QA stage

### **Background**

The assess QA stage was introduced from Fund 3 to provide the proposers a way to report “unfair” assessments received from Community Advisor in the ASSESS stage, to ensure that assessments submitted by the Community Advisors are adequate to the CA guidelines and also to highlight high quality assessments (“Constructive Feedback”).

From Fund 4 this process includes the use of [the yellow and red card thing](the-yellow-and-red-card-thing.md), a flagging model developed using the football (soccer) analog of a red and yellow card system.



### Phases

The assess QA stage consists of three main phases:&#x20;

1. Proposers flag assessments
2. vCA review assessments
3. Yellow and Red cards are assigned



## 1. Proposers flag assessments

In this phase will be generated a Google Sheet containing all the assessments submitted by Community Advisors.

Proposers will receive an email from Project Catalyst with the link to the Google Sheet and the instructions to report unfair assessments.

Each proposer can report an assessment received for their proposals (and only for their proposal), flagging one or more criteria described in [the yellow and red card thing](the-yellow-and-red-card-thing.md) (Offense / Hostility / Profanity / Unsubstantiated accusations, Non-constructive feedback, The score doesn’t match the rationale, Assessment copied systematically without justified cause, Incomplete Reading of Proposal, Assessment is not related to the proposal, General infraction).

Please refer to the [yellow and red card thing](the-yellow-and-red-card-thing.md) to have a detailed explanation of each criteria.

Blank assessments will be automatically flagged by the scripts.

The proposer could also report an assessment for Constructive Feedback, which allows assessments with high quality standards to be highlighted and be used as examples for other Community Advisors.

Note:

* If a proposer reports a General infraction, it is a requirement to provide a rationale for that: if there is no rationale the scripts will exclude the flag.&#x20;
* If a proposer reports any infraction, he is not allowed to also report a Constructive Feedback for the same assessments: if such a situation is created, the scripts will exclude the flag.
* If any of the criteria will be flagged by a proposer (the good or the bad ones) a generic “Proposer Flag” will be created on the file used by vCA to review the assessments.

The vCAs will focus primarily on these assessments.

To avoid introducing bias into the work of vCAs, the reason for a "proposer flag" or the rationale written by a proposer for the General infraction, will not be visible to the vCAs.



## 2. vCA review assessments

In this phase a Google Sheet will be generated from the one used by the Proposers: any assessments that have been flagged by proposers will be indicated with a generic “Proposer flag”.

Veteran Community Advisors will receive an email from Project Catalyst with the link to the Google Sheet and the instruction review assessments.

The veteran Community Advisors (those who have been eligible for rewards in previous funds) will review all the assessments submitted by Community Advisors, focusing primarily on the assessments flagged by proposers.

To avoid introducing bias into the work of vCAs, the reason for a "proposer flag" or the rationale written by a proposer for the General infraction, will not be visible to the vCAs.

Each vCA can review an assessment, flagging one or more criteria described in [the yellow and red card thing](the-yellow-and-red-card-thing.md) (Acceptable, Offense / Hostility / Profanity / Unsubstantiated accusations, Non-constructive feedback, The score doesn’t match the rationale, Assessment copied systematically without justified cause, Incomplete Reading of Proposal, Assessment is not related to the proposal, General infraction).

Each vCA will work autonomously on their own copy of the file. Unlike CAs, vCAs reviews are not anonymous.

Note:

* If a vCA reports a General infraction, it is a requirement to provide a rationale for that: if there is no rationale the scripts will exclude the flag.
* If a vCA reports any infraction, he is not allowed to also flag Acceptable or Constructive Feedback for the same assessments: if such a situation is created, the scripts will exclude the flag.
* A vCA can also flag “Abstain”, “Lenient” and “Strict” for an assessment: these flags will not be counted for the calculation of consensus, but his decision will be important for obtaining data and improving the process.



## 3. Yellow and Red cards are assigned

All the reviews made by vCAs will be collected and a script will calculate the consensus for each criteria according to the rules defined in [the yellow and red card thing](the-yellow-and-red-card-thing.md).&#x20;

If a CA receives a red card, all his assessments will be excluded.

If an assessment receives a yellow card, only that specific assessment will be excluded (this applies to each specific assessment for each criterion, not to the entire triplet sent by the CA).&#x20;

After this the scripts will produce a list of all valid assessments that will be used to calculate the rating of proposals.&#x20;

All the documents used in the process - the “Google Sheet for proposers” and the “vCA aggregated document” (the Google Sheet that will contain all files produced by the individual vCAs, the summary of the consensus calculations, the list of valid assessments and the list of excluded assessments) - will be published to the community for transparency and continued improvement within this system at the end of the QA Assess stage.
