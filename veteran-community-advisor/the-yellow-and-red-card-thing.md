# The Yellow And Red Card Thing

### Introduction

This document was created to establish criteria for evaluating assessments made by Community Advisors. These criteria aim to set up guidelines for vCAs (Veteran Community Advisors) to evaluate assessments in a more objective and uniform way. The intent of the guidelines is to minimize the subjectivity of the ASSESS QA stage and to allow for a fairer and aligned assessment.

The idea is that CAs (Community advisors) receive feedback for their assessments and that the process enables correction of disqualified assessments and introduces a quality control model.

It has been discussed that a flagging model be developed using the football (soccer) analog of a red and yellow card system. Where a red card is an automatic disqualification and a yellow card is given for less serious infraction and once a threshold has passed will lead to a red card and disqualification.

Recurring blank rationales or offensive assessments will be considered severe infractions and subject to a red card, this would result in the exclusion of the CA from the RESPECTIVE FUND, the exclusion of all his assessments and the loss of the possibility of receiving rewards in the current fund.

Assessments rationales that do not include serious infractions (red card), but are not considered satisfactory will be evaluated differently by vCAs and may result in yellow cards. The yellow cards remove the assessment of the CA from the respective proposal, as well as their participation in the respective ballot.

In future Funds, the idea is that an excess of yellow cards from a given CA will result in a red card, but as the implementation of this model is still an experiment, we will be conservative and observe Fund5 results and data before introducing other measures for quality.

In Funds 2 and 3 there was a black and white disqualification system. However, it meant that when assessing the assessments there was no way to apply leeway or a harsh penalty without philosophical thought and considerations of the outcome one way or the other. With the greater flexibility of the yellow cards, it allows a CA to have a second chance and not be penalized in an excessive way, but still keeps his work in check so that it is consistent.



**Consensus Building**

For a consensus to exist, the minimum number of vCAs evaluating an assessment must be at least four (4). Assessments with less than four (4) reviews could end up with a distorted overall review due to the low participation of vCAs, and should be kept UNCHANGED, to avoid manipulation and excess power of the vCAs.



### **Red card**

**Blank assessments**

The identification of blank assessments will be done automatically, through a script.

This script will count the total amount of assessments of a given CA, if more than 10% of the assessments rationales of a CA have been submitted in blank, the CA will automatically receive a red card and will be excluded from the respective Fund, losing the possibility of participating in the ballots of the current Fund and having all his assessments removed of the current Fund.

According to the CA established guidelines, CAs need to describe 3 rationales for all their assessments, the introduction of the red card for CAs with more than 10% of blank assessments rationales is a way to discourage CAs who do not follow the guidelines and at the same time maintain a margin of error to avoid excess of rigor in cases where CAs may have forgotten some rationale or if there was a problem with the submission on the Ideascale website.

However, in order for the CA to avoid these possible problems, it is important that Ideascale provides a dashboard where CAs can practically access their completed assessments, this gives the CAs a chance to correct blank assessments and reward them for keeping checks and balances.

If there is no dashboard in IdeaScale where the CAs can see their completed assessments in a single section, the recommendation is to change the 10% margin for a 20% tolerance for blank assessments rationales.

**Offense / Hostility / Profanity / Unsubstantiated accusations**

If 50% or more of the vCAs (who participated in the specific assessment review) report one or more of the below criteria, the CA will receive a red card and will be excluded from the respective fund forfeiting the right to rewards.



1. Offense
2. Hostility (Aggressive/hostile tone)
3. Profanity or
4. Unsubstantiated accusations (Remarks like "This looks like scam" and "This is just a money minting proposal" are serious accusations and need solid evidence. Accusations of this kind without details and plausible justifications must be avoided in order to maintain the integrity of both parties.)



### Yellow card

**Non-constructive feedback**

The purpose of having assessments in Catalyst is to promote constructive criticism. Through constructive assessments voters can have a summary and qualified evaluation of proposals in order to facilitate their decision making, allowing them to have their questions answered, and that proposers can have constructive feedback on the proposal, how to improve the proposal or why it is good.

A good assessment should teach you something: The voter should be more knowledgeable, the proposer should know what she needs to work on.

It is also important that the CA maintains objectivity in his assessment. Opinions without foundation / data to qualify the assessment can categorize a non-constructive assessment.

Furthermore, it’s not the duty of the CA to decide which ideas should be voted on, it’s the voter’s duty. CAs should just focus on the 3 criterias of evaluation (for example: impact, auditability and feasibility). Remarks such as: “We have too many NFT marketplaces” or “I don’t think we should fund this as a community” are examples of unfounded opinions that should be avoided, as they do not offer constructive feedback.

That said, if an assessment rationale doesn't assist the voter or proposer in any way, doesn’t clearly justify the given rating and contains no reasonable justification about the rationale, how to improve the proposal or why it is good, then that assessment isn’t constructive.

Also watch for:

* Simple rephrasal of the proposal text.
* Simple rephrasal of the assessment question as an affirmation or negation: “This proposal clearly addresses the challenge and is very well written with very carefully chosen words of adequate length, well done!”
* Assessments that could have been written without reading the proposal or fit any proposal.

If 50% or more of the vCAs (who participated in the specific assessment review) consider that the rationale wasn’t constructive, the CA will receive a yellow card, his assessment will be excluded, as well as the monetization of the assessment.

****

**The score doesn’t match the rationale**

If 50% or more of the vCAs (who participated in the specific assessment review) consider that the score doesn’t match the rationale, the CA will receive a yellow card, his assessment will be excluded, as well as the monetization of the assessment.

In this case, we must be attentive to evaluations that praise a proposal but give a low score or assessments that negatively criticize a proposal but give a high score.

****

**Assessment copied systematically without justified cause**

Some CAs use templates and this makes some assessments look alike, this is not necessarily a problem.

Cases where yellow cards should be applied:

* Similar copies from DIFFERENT COMMUNITY ADVISORS (compare by id number of the CA)
* Similar copies for no apparent reason (the same CA may have similar assessments, as long as this is plausible and the assessment makes sense)

If 50% or more of the vCAs (who participated in the specific assessment review) consider that the rationale has been copied, the CA will receive a yellow card, his assessment will be excluded, as well as the monetization of the assessment.

****

**Incomplete Reading of Proposal**

If 50% or more of the vCAs (who participated in the specific assessment review) consider that the CA clearly failed to notice any aspect that was described in the proposal or in the attached files and his assessment was compromised, for example: details about budget allocation, details about the time experience have been disregarded, the CA will receive a yellow card, his assessment will be excluded, as well as the monetization of the assessment.

****

**Assessment is not related to the proposal**

If 50% or more of the vCAs (who participated in the specific assessment review) consider that the rationale is:

* Totally out of context
* Or, was made for the wrong challenge (Must be clear that the assessment was done based on the wrong challenge category)
* Or, was made for the wrong criteria (Examples: impact, feasibility, auditability)

the CA will receive a yellow card, his assessment will be excluded, as well as the monetization of the assessment.

****

**General infraction**

If 50% or more of the vCAs (who participated in the specific assessment review) consider that the proposer's claim makes sense and the CA did not act within the CAs guidelines or made a clear assessment error in its rationale, the CA will receive a yellow card, his assessment of the respective proposal will be excluded, as well as the monetization of the assessment.

Due to the subjective nature of this criteria, it is recommended that only vCAs who have knowledge and feel comfortable about the subject of the proposal participate, as the evaluation of vCA in these cases may require additional expertise.



### **Additional** criteria (not cards, just categories)

These criteria will not be used for the attribution of cards, only indicative for improvements in the process.

The inclusion of these categories would allow us to see the pattern of behavior of a CA, if he is very strict in some assessments and lenient in others, we can see that he may be biased. We will not award yellow cards, but this can allow monitoring of strange behavior and obtain data to improve the process.\
\
As we already have the option of signaling "Constructive Feedback", FAIR signaling ended up being redundant or exaggerated. Therefore, the FAIR category will be removed and the ABSTAIN and ACCEPTABLE categories will be included instead.



**Constructive Feedback**

This category allows assessments with high quality standards to be highlighted and be used as examples for other Community Advisors, they are in accordance with the guidelines, they are constructive and well written. The decision of the CA will be counted for the calculation of consensus.

****

**Acceptable**

The assessment is within what is expected, is in accordance with the CA guidelines, constructive and there is no need for cards (red or yellow). The decision of the CA will be counted for the calculation of consensus.

****

**Abstain**

This category allows us to know that vCA analyzed the proposal, didn’t find it clear that the assessment is Acceptable or deserves a card(red or yellow). So, it would be appropriate to maintain neutrality and abstain. The decision of the CA will not be counted for the calculation of consensus, but his decision will be important for obtaining data and improving the process.

****

**Lenient**

The assessment might align with the guidelines but is overly soft with the rating. Would be an assessment that picks out one criterion of the proposal as legitimation for a high rating, disregarding the problems presented in the proposal. The decision of the CA will not be counted for the calculation of consensus, but his decision will be important for obtaining data and improving the process.



**Strict**

The assessment might align with the guidelines but is overly harsh with the rating. Would be an assessment that picks out one criterion of the proposal as legitimation for a low rating, disregarding the positive aspects/information presented in the proposal. The decision of the CA will not be counted for the calculation of consensus, but his decision will be important for obtaining data and improving the process.
